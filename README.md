Purpose: Multiple studies reveal that the false alarm rate (FAR) demonstrated by intensive care unit (ICU) vital sign monitors ranges from 72% to 99%. In this paper, we apply machine-learning (ML) methods to ICU multi-sensor information to imitate a medical specialist in diagnosing a patient's condition. We hypothesize that applying an ML data-driven approach toward developing a clinical alarm model that overcomes missing data in sensors of medical monitors will help to reduce FAR reported in ICUs. 
Methods: An expert-based rules algorithm was used to identify seven clinical scenarios: Bradycardia, Bradycardia hypotension, Hypovolemia, Tachycardia, Tachycardia hypotension, Obstructive shock, and Left ventricular (LV) shock, and to tag patient records in a database collected at the Tel-Aviv Medical Center (TAMC). We compared a random forest (RF) ML model trained on datasets with missing parameters (e.g., heart rate or blood pressure)  with the full expert-based rules (FER), our ground truth, and partial expert-based rules (PER), for which rules based on the missing parameters were removed.
Results: When all seven clinical alarm scenarios were examined collectively, RF and FER were identically perfect (Youden’s index and precision values of 0.99 or 1). However, while in the absence of one to three parameters, RF kept its high value of Youden’s index (0.94-0.97, depending on the number of missing parameters), PER lost its high value (to levels of 0.54-0.8), and similarly for the precision (0.98-0.99 for RF vs. 0.76-0.88 for PER). While FAR for PER with missing parameters was 17-39%, that for RF was only 1-2%. In addition, when each scenario was examined separately, RF showed clear superiority over PER (let alone cases PER could not come to decision) in almost all combinations of scenario and number of missing parameters.
Conclusion: While the RF model attains its high accuracy and low FAR when sensor data become missing, the specialist performance worsens with the number of missing parameters (sensors). We attribute the RF success to its ability to fuse information from the available sensors compensating for those missing.
